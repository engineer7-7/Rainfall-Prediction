# Rainfall Prediction Project

This project involves analyzing and predicting rainfall patterns using machine learning models. The dataset includes weather-related variables like temperature, humidity, cloud coverage, and more. Multiple models are implemented and evaluated to predict whether it will rain or not based on the features.

## Dataset

The dataset `Rainfall.csv` contains weather data with the following columns:
- `pressure`: Atmospheric pressure
- `humidity`: Humidity level
- `cloud`: Cloud coverage
- `winddirection`: Direction of wind
- `temperature`: Recorded temperature
- `sunshine`: Sunshine duration
- `rainfall`: Target column, indicating whether rainfall occurred or not
